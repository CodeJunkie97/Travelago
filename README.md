# Full App Description
This is a full stack ReactJS and NodeJS application that I have been working on for the past few weeks. This site is very similar to Travel.com or other travel and booking agency websites that are able to book hotels, flights, rental cars, and more to meet customer travel needs. This is the first personal project I have ever worked on with React and Node where I am using Fecth Hooks and also using Context to keep track of both search and current user data. The current implementation currently has the API built to track the hotels and rooms feature of the page. The page currently supports searching Hotels and Rooms by city and destination and I am currently working on adding the physical booking feature for that before I begin work on the flgihts, rental cars, and other features and searches I plan on making available in this application. 

# Current Status
At this point in time, I have completed most of the Front End/UI Portion of the application and the API build for the hotels and rooms tab of the booking application. It has a search and authentication context that allows you to search hotels by city and keeps login information from page to page.

# Still to Come
The next step for this application is for me to finish the front end and back end functionality to allow customers to search for flights and then rental cars, in a similar fashion to how i completed the hotels portion of the application. In the further future once I have completed all of the functionality for this website, I will connect it to my Data Administrator Dashboard Portal that I created for my Flix-Movie-Streaming application but can be tweaked to support applications like this if needed.
